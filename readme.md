A rust wrapper for the Mustang CLI.

In the future I might use jni but currently I just call it in a subprocess.

### Notice

This project is in no way affiliated with the Mustang Project.

### Other notes

To reduce the dependency size, I've been experimenting with ProGuard and GraalVM, but so far haven't been able to get it to work.
